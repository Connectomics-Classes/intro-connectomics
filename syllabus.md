### Course Description

In recent years, advances in technology have enabled researchers to ask new questions predicated on the collection and analysis of big datasets that were previously too large to study. More specifically, many fundamental questions in neuroscience require studying brain tissue at large scales to discover emergent properties of neural computation, consciousness, and etiologies of brain disorders. A major challenge is to reconstruct the map (e.g., structural wiring diagram) of the brain, called a connectome.

This course will introduce the emerging field of connectomics, and give students the opportunity to directly contribute to ongoing research efforts within the JHU NeuroData team and beyond. The field of brain mapping spans a variety of resolutions and imaging modalities and promises insight into areas such as biofidelic algorithms and the validation of the cortical column hypothesis first proposed at JHU by Vernon Mountcastle in the 1960s.  We will begin by broadly surveying the field of brain mapping across these different scales, and more deeply examine research in ultrastructure electron microscopy reconstruction efforts.  Students will learn about scalable algorithms and approaches to extract graphs from large image volumes O(100 TB), and the importance of computer science in addressing modern neuroscience challenges.  

### Grading Policy and Deliverables

This course is intended to provide insights into a new and growing field, and strengthen your background as scientists, and so is offered pass/fail (S/U).  There are no exams, however students are expected to attend all classes unless prior arrangements have been made.  To receive a grade of Satisfactory, students should:

- Attend every class.  Students missing more than one class may not receive credit.
- Participate.  Students are expected to be engaged in class, complete assignments and ask questions regularly (aim for at least 1/class).
- Present a journal paper with slides to the class and discuss the contribution.  All students are responsible for reading all papers.
- Actively contribute to a group project, including a project presentation and report.
- Other assignments as given in class.

This class will move quickly given the short time frame; the amount you learn is strongly correlated with the time and effort you contribute!  Students without any prior background in this field are welcome and will be able to succeed.

### Course Schedule
Each class will consist of a lecture, paper presentations, workshop activity, and group project lab.  We will explore a different facet of connectomics each class:

- Class 1:  NeuroData:  Enabling Data-Driven Neuroscience Discovery
- Class 2:  Mesoscale Connectomics:  Magnetic Resonance Imaging-based Graph Estimation
- Class 3:  Nanoscale Connectomics:  Electron Microscopy-based Graph Estimation
- Class 4:  Introduction to Graph Theory
- Class 5:  Computer Vision and Machine Learning
- Class 6:  Approaches for Big Data Storage, Visualization, and Analysis
- Class 7:  TBD/Lab Session
- Class 8:  Strategically Approaching Research Questions and Our Journeys
- Class 9:  What's Next?  Other Approaches, Challenges in Connectomics and Poster Session

### Typical Day

- 2:45p:  Lecture/Guest Lecture
- 3:45p:  3 student presentations, 8-10 minutes + questions
- 4:30p:  Mini Lecture/Help session
- 5p:  Project Lab / Collaboration Time

### Workload

The workload of this class is higher than other intersession classes, because the field of connectomics is large and we want to make sure you have time to get up to speed, learn about the field, and contribute back with a novel research idea, all in just three weeks.  We will provide group time during class and office hours throughout the three weeks, but will also require you to spend additional time on your paper presentations, research and posters outside of class.  If anyone is worried that they don't know anything about this field yet, please don't worry - we'll start with the basics and go from there. 

### Honor Code
For this course, collaboration is encouraged, and referencing outside resources is permitted, unless expressly noted.  The work you turn in must be original and your own - you are required to acknowledge significant help received, as well as sources consulted (i.e., citations).  

### Final Thoughts
We are excited to teach you about the field of connectomics and support you however we can.  Please feel free to reach out (email is best) with questions or comments at any point.
Opportunities to continue research in the Spring semester may be available, for the motivated student.  This will require a minimum of 15-20 hours of committed time each week, and is generally offered for credit only.
